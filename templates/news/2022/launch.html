<p class="c0"><span>As Editors-in-Chief, Hugo, Kyunghyun, and myself are delighted to announce that the Transactions on
        Machine Learning Research (TMLR) is now accepting submissions! Some of you have expressed your eagerness to send

            Editors</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and reviewers have been recruited. It&rsquo;s exciting to see TMLR
        becoming a reality, and we are grateful for all our supporters: the volunteers that have helped give feedback
        and debug the review process; all of you that have agreed to be AEs or reviewers; our advisors and sponsors; and
        everyone that has expressed enthusiasm for the project.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As it grows, we hope that TMLR will become a central resource for the machine learning
        community&ndash;a continuous thoroughfare of publications and new ideas. TMLR will not have annual issues or
        proceedings, so we suggest that you keep up to date on new submissions, new accepted papers, and new
        certifications by signing up for our </span><span>mailing list digest</span><span>&nbsp;(either </span><span

            papers</a></span><span>. If you were not invited to be a reviewer, or were invited but couldn&rsquo;t accept
        because of other commitments, please keep an eye out for new submissions that are in your area of expertise -
        you are welcome to contribute and </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2"
            href="https://jmlr.org/tmlr/contact.html%23solicit&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1648047080669488&amp;usg=AOvVaw32D0QC2kavayc_lzi_j0cf">solicit
            to review a submission</a></span><span class="c1">, subject to approval by the action editor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Looking forward, we hope for a smooth and successful launch of the review process, but of course we
        are prepared for bumps in the road. In particular, while we have recruited a sizeable pool of over 150 Action
        Editors and over 1500 reviewers, this will allow us to handle only 150 submissions per month because we have
        strict quotas on how many papers may be assigned to any AE or reviewer. If this number of submissions is
        exceeded, it would result in longer review turnarounds or higher quotas, which we have decided is not
        acceptable. </span><span class="c6 c7">Therefore, in the event that our capacity is reached, TMLR will stop
        accepting submissions temporarily.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We will also be closely monitoring authors with
        high numbers of submissions, in case it becomes necessary to impose individual limits to maintain fair access
        for all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As the first submissions come through, you will start to see different certifications awarded to
        accepted papers - </span><span class="c6">Survey</span><span>&nbsp;certifications for papers that include
        exceptionally thorough or insightful surveys of literature and methods; </span><span
        class="c6">Reproducibility</span><span>&nbsp;certifications for papers that go beyond simple verification of a
        previous result and contribute valuable analyses or additional experiments which provide new insights;
    </span><span class="c6">Featured</span><span>&nbsp;certifications for high quality papers which are selected by the
        Action Editor - roughly the equivalent of choosing a paper for an oral/spotlight at a top tier conference. There
        will be more certifications over time: the </span><span class="c6">Outstanding </span><span>certification is
        awarded by the Editors-In-Chief, approximately on an annual basis, and the </span><span class="c6">Expert
        Reviewer </span><span class="c1">certification will be awarded to papers authored by very highly rated
        reviewers, but this will have to wait until we have enough evidence to identify those expert reviewers.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the future, we hope to use TMLR certifications for reviewing or publishing special topics or
        collections, for instance through aligning with a workshop or small conference. The certification would be
        edited and awarded by a guest editor or committee. If you are </span><span>interested in
        working</span><span>&nbsp;with TMLR on developing a certification, please </span><span class="c1"><a class="c3"
            href="mailto:tmlr-editors@jmlr.org">reach out to us</a></span><span class="c0">. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p><span>Another development we are considering for the future is to support non-PDF, interactive
        submissions. Since TMLR has no paper proceedings, is entirely online and isn&rsquo;t bound to paper, we see this
        as an opportunity to innovate on the format of scientific publications. Our first step is to set up an internal
        committee tasked with exploring our options and making recommendations adapted to TMLR. Stay tuned for more on
        this!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p><span>Of course, there may be other rocky areas to navigate in the first few months! We apologize in
        advance for any issues that come up; do remember that this is a new effort, and be kind to us. Please check the
