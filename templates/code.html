    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span>(Based on </span><span class="c11"><a class="c6"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1638474498167000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kDPRGr53h0O0LJ5GqHXH3">ICLR
                Code of Conduct</a></span><span>)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Transactions on Machine Learning Research (&ldquo;TMLR&rdquo;) aims at providing
            an online publication venue in which open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and
            respectful scientific debate are pursued. This requires a community, including authors, reviewers, editors
            and public commentators, to recognize and respect the inherent worth of every person. This Code of Conduct
            lays out conduct expected by every participant of TMLR.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.yi5g3rwmvbp"><span class="c7">Who</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span>TMLR is based on an open review process. We consider authors, reviewers, action editors,
            editors-in-chief, advisory board members, staff members, and public commentators as the participants of TMLR
            (&ldquo;Participants&#39;&#39;). </span><span>Each and every Participant must agree with the
            Code of Conduct before participating in any activity of TMLR.
        </span><span>Editors</span><span class="c0">-in-Chief of TMLR (&ldquo;Editors&rdquo;) will enforce this code and
            expect cooperation from all Participants to help ensure a safe and productive scientific venue for
            everyone.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.rplygtbhjell"><span class="c7">Scope</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">TMLR commits itself to providing an environment in which all Participants can engage
            in scientific discourses free from harassment, bullying, discrimination and retaliation. This includes
            offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), politics, technology choices or
            any other personal characteristics. TMLR will not tolerate bullying, intimidation, personal attacks,
            harassment and any behaviour that interferes with another Participant&rsquo;s full participation. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span>The code applies to all activities of TMLR, including but not limited to scientific discussion
            using online tools used and/or maintained by TMLR for the purposes of reviewing and publication, direct
            correspondences between Participants regarding manuscripts under review, in press and published at
            TMLR</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In particular, we strictly forbid trolling, use of
            inappropriate imagery, offensive language and doxxing, or revealing any personal information to target any
            Participant.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.qw3f3kwrsqi2"><span class="c7">Outcomes</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span>Any Participant is expected to comply with the code whenever asked by any other Participant or
            Editors of TMLR. If a Participant engages in inappropriate behaviour forbidden by the Code of Conduct,
            Editors may take any action they deem appropriate, including: issuing a formal or informal warning to the
            offender, barring them from </span><span>submitting a manuscript</span><span class="c0">, comments or
            reviews on TMLR&rsquo;s OpenReview for a fixed duration, reporting the incident to the offender&rsquo;s
            employer and/or funding agencies, and reporting the incident to law enforcement. If any action is taken by
            Editors, Editors will prepare an appeals process for the offending Participant.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.kkk5p0omjgfj"><span class="c7">Reporting</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">If you fall victim to the violation of the Code of Conduct or witness the violation
            of the Code of Conduct by other Participants, please email the Editors of TMLR. Your reports will be handled
            with discretion. Editors will strive to respond to your report within two weeks of receiving it. Editors
