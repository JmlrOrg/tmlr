    <h1><span>Submission Guidelines and Editorial Policies </span></h1>
    
    <h2><span>Scope</span></h2>
    <p><span>TMLR&rsquo;s objective is to publish original papers that </span><span>contribute to the
            understanding of the computational and mathematical principles that enable intelligence through learning, be
            it in brains or in machines.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">To this end, TMLR invites authors to submit papers that contain </span></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul class="c9 start">
        <li><span class="c1">new algorithms with sound empirical validation, optionally with
                justification of theoretical, psychological, or biological nature;</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into
                the design and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">accounts of applications of existing techniques that shed light
                on the strengths and weaknesses of the methods;</span></li>
        <li><span>formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new
                applications) and of methods for </span><span>assessing performance on those tasks</span><span
                class="c1">;</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical
                studies of practical learning methods;</span></li>
        <li><span>computational models of natural learning systems at the behavioral or neural
                level</span><span class="c1">;</span></li>
        <li><span>reproducibility studies of previously published results or
                claims</span><span class="c1">;</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">new approaches for analysis, visualization, and understanding of
                artificial or biological learning systems;</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">surveys that draw new connections, highlight trends, and suggest new problems in an area.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span>Dual Submissions and Originality</span></h2>
    <p><span>Unlike many other journals, TMLR only accepts original contributions that don&rsquo;t reuse the
            authors&rsquo; own prior work. </span><span class="bold">In particular, we do not accept submissions that are
            expanded versions of conference papers.</span><span>&nbsp;There should not be any reuse of written text,
            figures or results between the submitted paper and any paper which has been published, accepted for
            publication, or submitted in parallel at another archival, peer-reviewed venue. It is acceptable for a
            submission to overlap with the author's previous work if it was shared </span><span>at venues or tracks that are publicly declared, in
            writing, to be non-archival, such as workshops</span><span class="c1">, or on preprint servers such as arXiv
            and bioRxiv. </span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">Review process</span></h2>
    <p><span>TMLR uses an open-reviewing,</span><span>&nbsp;double-blind process</span><span class="c1">. An
            open reviewing model, where papers, reviews, and discussion are visible to the public, provides several
            benefits, including transparency of the process, reviews which are higher-quality and more constructive, and
            easier communication between authors and reviewers. Since there is ample evidence that single-blind
            reviewing may lead to biased outcomes, we follow a double blind model where the identities of authors and
            invited reviewers are withheld. Reviewers are expected not to take any actions that would violate this double blind state, e.g. searching for related presentations or arXiv preprints.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">The review process can be summarized in the following four phases:</span></p>
    <ol class="c9 start" start="1">
        <li><span class="bold">Submission</span><span class="bold">. </span><span>The manuscript
                is submitted</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span class="c11"><a class="c2"
                    href="https://openreview.net/group?id=TMLR">OpenReview</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in anonymized form, and the authors
                recommend an action editor to oversee the review process.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Reviewing. </span><span>An action editor </span><span>will be
                assigned</span><span>&nbsp;to the submission within a week. They will evaluate the submission, and may
                reject it immediately for being out of scope or of poor quality, or having format violations (contingent
                on Editor-in-Chief approval). Otherwise, the action editor will assign at least three qualified
                reviewers and the paper will become public. Members of the public may volunteer to review the paper;
                accepting such offers is up to the </span><span>discretion of the action editor</span><span class="c1">.
            </span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Rebuttal and discussion.</span><span>&nbsp;Reviews will be
                visible to the authors as they are submitted, but the reviews will not be visible to the public nor to
                the other reviewers until all the reviews are submitted in order to keep them independent. Authors may
                post rebuttals and update their papers in response to the </span><span>reviews</span><span class="c1">,
                and the reviewers and editor may privately discuss the paper. Authors can respond to a review as soon as
                it is posted, however we recommend waiting until all 3 reviews have been submitted before submitting any
                revised version of the PDF manuscript. Reviewers will be able to submit their final recommendations once
                at least two weeks have elapsed after all 3 reviews became public.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Decision. </span><span class="c1">The discussion period ends when
                the action editor enters a decision for the paper, which is one of the following: <br></span>
    <ul class="c9 start">
        <li class="c0 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="bold">Accept as is:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the author is
                notified, and, once the camera ready version is submitted and verified, the manuscript is published.
            </span></li>
        <li class="c0 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="bold">Accept with minor revision:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the
                author is notified of the required revisions, and, once the revised camera ready version is submitted
                and verified, the manuscript is published.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="bold">Reject: </span><span>the author is notified of the rejection,
                and the </span><span>action editor</span><span>&nbsp;indicates whether they would be willing to consider
                a significantly revised version of the manuscript. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The submission
                remains publicly available on OpenReview and the authors are given the
            </span><span>opportunity</span><span>&nbsp;to reveal their identity. &nbsp;Doing so will preclude them from
                submitting a revised version of the manuscript to TMLR.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
    <p></p>
    <p class="c0 c16"><span class="c1">Authors of a rejected submission may revise and resubmit their paper, but it will
            need to be entered as a new submission and a link provided to the previously rejected submission as well as a
            description of the changes made since. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>Authors of accepted papers must provide a &ldquo;</span><span>camera ready</span><span>&rdquo;
            version, verified by the action editor, which would </span><span>include a link to the </span><span>review
            page</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>for the paper</span><span class="c1">. The author is encouraged to
            submit additional materials that can help to support their paper, such as a video presentation or
            code.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">An author may decide to <b>withdraw</b> their submission before a decision has been entered, 
        or they may decide to <b>retract</b> their submission after acceptance. In the former case, authors may trigger 
        the withdrawal themselves, through OpenReview. The author will need to enter a reason for the withdrawal, 
        and the submission will remain on OpenReview but its status will be explicitly marked as withdrawn. The authors 
        will be given the option to reveal their identity, otherwise the submission will remain public but anonymous.
</span></p>
    <p></p>

    <p>If an author decides to retract their paper after it is accepted, they will need to enter a retraction statement 
        in OpenReview. The retraction statement will be reviewed by the Editors-in-Chief and all authors will be contacted. 
        Once the retraction is confirmed, the paper will remain on OpenReview but its status will be marked as retracted.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>The Editors-in-Chief may also decide to withdraw a submission or retract an accepted paper if it is found to contain 
        unethical research, any plagiarized content (including figures), or findings that are erroneous (due to misconduct or honest error).</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Our <a href="ethics.html">Ethics Guidelines</a> describe TMLR&rsquo;s ethical principles and establish common
            ground for editors, reviewers, and authors to evaluate the potential for harm of a proposed work.
            Submissions which describe work with the potential for harm should clearly describe the risks and
            mitigations in an (otherwise optional) Broader Impact Statement. In situations where a reviewer with ethics
            expertise is required to evaluate the impact and potential for harm, or where the action editor suspects
            that no statement would make the work ethically acceptable, reach out to the
       <a href="mailto:tmlr@jmlr.org">Editors-in-Chief</a>. </span>
    </p>
    <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation criteria</h2>
    <p><span class="c1">The acceptance decision for a submission is based on the answers to the following
            questions: </span></p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_rmx32wqtge81-0 start">
        <li><span class="italic">Are the claims made in the </span><span class="italic">submission
                supported by accurate, convincing and clear evidence</span><span class="italic c19">?</span></li>
        <li><span class="italic">Would at least some individuals in TMLR&#39;s audience be
                interested in knowing the findings of this paper?</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Papers should be accepted if they meet the criteria, <span class="italic">even
            if the contribution or significance of the work is modest</span>. Papers that should not
            be accepted include papers that make bold statements unsupported by empirical or rigorous evidence, papers
            that aren&rsquo;t clearly written, papers that incorrectly claim novelty over existing
            published work, and papers that merely re-implement an idea that has already been reproduced before. See the <a href="acceptance-criteria.html">Acceptance criteria</a> for a more thorough discussion. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="certifications">Certifications</h2>
    <p><span>Accepted papers will be automatically considered for a number of certifications that may be
            awarded by the </span><span>action editors or editors-in-chief</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of TMLR. These
            certifications will act as public endorsements of the paper in a number of categories. The most prestigious
            award is the Outstanding certificate, which is jointly approved by all editors-in-chief:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_pfdlg1ai0z44-0 start">
        <li><span class="bold">Outstanding Certification</span><span class="bold">.
            </span><span>The editorial board of TMLR jointly awards this certification to papers which are deemed to be
                exceptionally high quality and broadly significant for the field. The certification </span><span>may be
                given well after the paper&rsquo;s initial publication in TMLR</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(a year or
                more), and is equivalent to a best paper award at a top-tier conference.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">Three other certifications are nominated by action editors and must be
            reviewed and approved by at least one editor-in-chief:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_pfdlg1ai0z44-0">
        <li><span class="bold">Featured Certification. </span><span class="c1">This
                certification may be awarded to papers that are very high quality. These papers present significant
                contributions which are novel, clearly explained, and well supported with evidence, theory, or analysis.
                If this paper was submitted to a top-tier conference, it would likely be presented as an
                oral/spotlight.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Reproducibility Certification. </span><span>This is awarded to
                papers whose pri</span><span class="c1">mary purpose is reproduction of other published work. Beyond
                simple verification, the paper must contribute significant added value through additional baselines,
                analysis, ablations, or insights.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Survey</span><span class="bold">&nbsp;Certification.
            </span><span>Papers that not only meet the criteria for acceptance but also provide an exceptionally
                thorough or insightful survey of the topic or approach may be awarded this certification.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="c1">Finally, an <span class="bold">Expert Certification</span> are awarded to papers that are <span>authored</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by
                highly-rated TMLR reviewers (i.e. our <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=TMLR/Expert_Reviewers">Expert Reviewers</a>), to recognize their contributions and expertise.</span></p>

    <h2><span class="c5">Open access policy</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">TMLR makes all published content immediately available to the public free of charge.
            TMLR imposes no fees or payments to authors, reviewers, action editors, or editors-in-chief.</span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">LLM Use policy</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">LLMs may be used as general-purpose assistive tools. Whichever tools are used, authors and reviewers are fully responsible for content on which they are listed as (co-) authors or reviewers. This includes, but is not limited to, content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts).  Low-quality contributions (be they submissions or reviews) that appear to be largely LLM-generated will be closely examined for evidence of the issues mentioned previously, such as scientific misconduct. LLMs are not eligible for authorship. We will periodically revise this policy as new information about the use of LLMs in the scientific process becomes available.</span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">Editorial structure</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">TMLR uses action editors to execute the review process. The action editor role is
            similar to the role of area chairs in conference reviewing, but action editors are recruited for a two-year
            renewable term and papers are assigned throughout the year. Action editors are responsible for acceptance
            decisions. In addition, TMLR has three editors-in-chief, with renewable terms up to 5 years, who are
            responsible for assigning submissions to action editors, approving ethics and misconduct decisions, and
            approving some certifications. There is also a TMLR advisory board, whose members have 3 year, renewable
            terms. </span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">Conflicts of interest</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">Authors and co-authors will use their OpenReview profile to identify domain and
            personal conflicts. Domain conflicts, entered in Education &amp; Career History, are used to identify
            institutions with which you have a conflict of interest from (at least) the last three years. Be judicious
            with domain conflicts and only use them if you have a genuine conflict. It is forbidden to state a false
            conflict in order to block potentially negative reviewers from an institution.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">For current or recent collaborations, including internships, you should generally use
            personal conflicts, which are recorded in the Advisors, Relations &amp; Conflicts section. The following
            constitutes a personal conflict:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_33xm9l40p51u-0 start">
        <li><span class="c1">Family or close personal relationship</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">Ph.D. advisee/advisor relationship</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">Current, frequent, or recent collaboration (where recent means
                within the past three years) </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>In some cases, you may have a personal conflict that is not covered by the definition above, but
            would nonetheless significantly compromise the fairness of the review process. &nbsp;You may choose to mark
            such a conflict as hidden from your OpenReview profile by changing its visibility. &nbsp;</span><span>If an
            action editor or editor-in-chief of TMLR has any reason to doubt the validity of such a conflict, the
            editors-in-chief may confidentially inquire into its nature.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">If a TMLR Editor-in-chief submits a paper to the journal, the other
            editor(s)-in-chief will choose an action editor that is not in conflict with any of the editors-in-chief to
            oversee the review. If a TMLR action editor submits a paper, it will be assigned to a different,
            non-conflicting action editor to oversee the review. </span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">Criteria for Authorship</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">Individuals should be listed as authors on a TMLR submission if and only if they satisfy all of the following criteria:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 start">
        <li><span class="c1">They have made a substantial intellectual contribution to the work described in the submission. This may include, but is not limited to: conception, design, or analysis of the work.</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">They have contributed to drafting or revising the submission.</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">They take full responsibility for all content in the final published work.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Furthermore, individuals listed as authors on a TMLR submission testify that:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 start">
        <li><span class="c1">They are aware the submission has been submitted to TMLR.</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">They agree to be held responsible and accountable for issues related to correctness or integrity of the work.</span></li>
        <li><span class="c1">To the best of their knowledge, the work submitted is original, all individuals who satisfy the authorship criteria outlined above are listed as authors, and the submission is an honest representation of the underlying work.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="c1">All authors must be listed on OpenReview at the time of submission, and may only be added later under exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Editors-in-Chief.</span></p>
    <p><span class="c1">TMLR gives no prescription on how to order authors, and this may be decided by the authors themselves in accordance with the customs of the subcommunity the work contributes to (e.g., alphabetically, in order of contribution, etc.). Authors may choose to include a statement indicating author contributions.</span></p>
    <p><span class="c1">Some parts of this policy are adapted from similar policies of <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM</a> and <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/ethical-requirements/">IEEE</a>.</span></p>
    <h2><span class="c5">Ethical publishing</span></h2>
    <p><span class="c1">Allegations of author, reviewer, or editor misconduct should be sent to the
            editors-in-chief, except that if the allegations concern an EiC, the allegations may be sent directly to the
            personal emails of the non-accused subset of the EiCs. </span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">To handle an allegation or discovery of misconduct, TMLR follows the Committee on
            Publishing Ethics&rsquo;s (COPE) guidelines listed below. According to these guidelines, a determination of
            misconduct may result in TMLR contacting the author institutions, funding agencies, and/or potential
            victims. At the discretion of the Editors-in-Chief, additional actions may be taken, including issuing
            an informal or formal warning to the offender and barring them from submitting a manuscript to TMLR for a fixed duration.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Intellectual property, including plagiarism or redundant (duplicate) publication:</span></p>

    <p></p>

    <p><span class="c1">After a paper is accepted and the Action Editor approves the camera-ready version, this version is considered final and the paper is published. Under exceptional circumstances, the authors may wish to revise the camera-ready version of the paper -- requests of this nature should be directed to the Editors in Chief, describing the nature of the revision and the reasons why this revision was not performed prior to publication.</span></p>

    <p><span class="c1">By default, TMLR follows COPE guidelines (e.g., for <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.2.10">adding</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.2.11">removing</a> authors, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.4">retracting</a> a paper). In the event that TMLR retracts a publication because evidence shows that the findings are unreliable, either because of misconduct or honest error, or that the findings have been plagiarized or previously published, or that the research is unethical), a Notice of Retraction will be attached to the paper on OpenReview.</span></p>

    <p><span class="c1">In the case of post-publication edits or corrections to the paper, the EiCs may involve the paper's Action Editor to judge the proposed edits, including their correctness and/or appropriateness (checking, e.g., if the paper instead ought be retracted, or if the changes should be included in a separate and subsequent publication). Any significant changes should be documented in a section at the end of the paper (subsequent to any Acknowledgments, prior to References) titled "Post-Publication Changes." In all cases of modifications to published papers or retractions, the paper's full revision history will remain visible on OpenReview, and the Editors in Chief will post a public comment on the OpenReview page upon update indicating the nature of any changes made to the paper.</span></p>
