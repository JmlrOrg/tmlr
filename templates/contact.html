    <h2 class="c4" id="h.4bf5f8p4ashz"><span class="c2">Authors</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Q: How is TMLR different from other machine learning journals such as JMLR?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: TMLR provides a similar experience to submitting to a conference &ndash;
            double-blind, open access reviews, fast turnaround, and novel, unpublished content &ndash; but with a
            rolling, year-round review process and evaluation criteria that focuses on technical correctness of claims
            rather than more subjective, editorial measures. Consider submitting shorter manuscripts to TMLR, and
            submitting extended works which incorporate previously published material to JMLR.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Q: How long will it take to review my manuscript?</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: TMLR does not make any guarantees, and manuscripts longer than 12 pages are
            subject to longer timescales, but in general the rolling review process aims to deliver a final decision
            approximately 8 weeks after submission.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c4" id="h.xwl9w6pcc4sy"><span>Reviewers</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Q: What if I have seen the paper at a workshop, on arXiv, on Twitter, etc, and I know
            who the authors are?</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: You should not try to de-anonymize any submission by actively searching for it.
            However, you may come across it by chance. If this happens, and you believe that it will influence your
            judgment, please contact the action editor, who will help decide whether you should be replaced with a new
            reviewer.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c4" id="h.82ajlcn8xqwm"><span class="c2">Action Editors</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Q: I am concerned that a submission, which is otherwise acceptable, violates the TMLR
            ethical guidelines; how should I handle this?</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: Consider whether the submission would be acceptable if the authors added or
            improved a broader impact statement, and if so, this can be required for the camera-ready version. If the
            submission carries significant risk of harm, contact the Editors-in-Chief.</span></p>
