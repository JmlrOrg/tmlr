JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers on machine learning that contain:
<ul>
	<li>new principled algorithms with sound empirical validation, and with justification of theoretical, psychological, or biological nature;</li>
	<!--
<li>
new algorithms with empirical, theoretical, psychological, or biological
justification;</li>
-->

<li>
experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into the design
and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;</li>

<li>
accounts of applications of existing techniques that shed light on the
strengths and weaknesses of the methods;</li>

<li>
formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new applications)
and of methods for assessing performance on those tasks;</li>

<li>
development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical studies
of practical learning methods;</li>

<li>
computational models of data from natural learning systems at the behavioral
or neural level</li>

</ul>

<p>JMLR occasionally publishes surveys, by invitation from the editorial board.</p>

<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Content">Content</a></h3>
Papers must be concise and complete; manuscripts should be carefully proofread
and polished. Submissions that do not meet these criteria may be returned
unreviewed.
<p>All claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical
experiments or theoretical analyses. When appropriate, authors are encouraged
to implement their work and to demonstrate its utility on significant problems;
any experiments reported should be reproducible. Papers describing systems
should clearly describe the contributions or the principles underlying
the system. Papers describing theoretical results should also discuss their
practical utility. In general, it should be clear how the work advances
the current state of understanding and why the advance matters. Papers
should report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely
on what was done.
<p>Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their predecessors,
and situate their submission in the context of the broader machine learning research literature.
If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques, it should also explain
why current terminology or techniques are insufficient.
<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Originality">Originality</a></h3>
<p>
Submissions to JMLR cannot have been published previously in any other journal.
We will consider submissions that have been published at workshops or
conferences.  In these cases, we expect the JMLR submission to cite the prior
work, go into much greater depth and to extend the published results in a
substantive way. In all cases, authors must notify JMLR about previous publication at
the time of submission, attach the previous paper as a supplementary
document, and explain the differences from their prior work.</p>

<p>We will also consider concurrent submissions of papers that are under review
at conferences, provided the conference explicitly allows for this. In this
case, too, we expect that the difference between the papers satisfy the above
requirements, and we ask authors to provide their conference submission to the
JMLR action editor in charge of the JMLR submission.</p>

<p>
Examples of (possibly) acceptable 'deltas' beyond a conference paper include:
new theoretical results, entirely new application domains,  significant new
insights and/or analyses. Examples of insufficient deltas include: adding
proofs that were omitted from a conference paper; minor variations or
extensions of previous experiments; adding extra background material or
references. However, we ultimately leave the decision about whether a 'delta'
is significant enough up to the individual reviewers.</p>

<p>Currently, JMLR does not publish review articles.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" NAME="Preprints">Preprints</a></h3>

<p>Authors may submit work to JMLR that is already available as a preprint, for example on arXiV or personal websites.
</p>


<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Submission">Submission procedure</a></h3>

<p>
JMLR accepts submissions via its own <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb/" target=_blank>electronic submission management system</a>.
</p>

<p> Submissions must be typeset in LaTex using the <a
href="https://github.com/JmlrOrg/jmlr-style-file">JMLR LaTeX style
file</a> described in the <a
href="http://www.jmlr.org/format/authors-guide.html"> authors
guide</a>.  Only PDF files should be submitted.  Papers not in the
JMLR style file will be rejected without review </p>

<p>Articles may be accompanied by online appendices containing data, demonstrations,
instructions for obtaining source code, or the source code itself&nbsp;
if appropriate. We strongly encourage authors to include such appendices
along with their papers. (Note: if an online appendix contains source code,
we will require you to sign a release form prior to publication freeing
us from liability.)
We also strongly encourage authors to submit their data sets to the
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.

<p> Articles must be accompanied by a cover letter (in PDF or plain text format) containing all of the below:
<ol>
    <li> Disclosure of any previous publications by the author(s) that significantly overlap with the submission. E.g., if the submission is an extended version of an earlier conference paper, please described the differences between the two papers. Simultaneous submission of papers to JMLR and other venues is not allowed.</li>
    <li> Confirmation that all co-authors are aware of the current submission and consent to its review by JMLR.</li>
    <li> Declaration of possible conflicts of interest; in particular, name all action editors that have recently collaborated with authors of the submission.</li>
    <!--<li> Suggestions of <a href="http://jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">action editors</a> that seem best suited to handle the submitted manuscript. These suggestions will be considered (though not necessarily honored). We have found that some action editors are popular with many authors, and may be busy handling other papers at a given point in time, so listing at least three action editors helps us expedite the process.</li>-->
    <li>Suggestions of 3 to 5 <a
    href="http://jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">action editors</a>
    that seem best suited to handle the submitted manuscript. These
    suggestions will be considered (though not necessarily
    honored). We have found that some action editors are popular with
    many authors, and may be busy handling other papers at a given
    point in time, so listing at least three action editors helps us
    expedite the process.</li>
    <li> Suggestions of 3 to 5 reviewers.  These suggestions will be
    considered (though, again, not necessarily taken) by the action
    editor.  As a reminder, do not suggest reviewers for whom there
    is a conflict of interest.  As one example, an advisee / advisor
    relationship is a lifelong conflict of interest.
</ol>
</p>

<p>To submit a paper, please</p>

<ol>
 <li>Prepare it in PDF format (if the submission
     contains multiple files, please create an archive in tar or zip format). </li>
<li>Prepare the cover letter as described above in another PDF or plain text file.</li>
 <li>Ensure
     that the file to be uploaded is less than 5Mb in size.</li>
 <li>Ensure
     that the title page contains</li>
 <ul>
  <li>complete
      name, post and e-mail address of the corresponding author;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>a
      condensed running title of fifty (50) characters or less</li>
  <li>a
      list of five key-words</li>
  <li>an
      abstract that does not exceed 200 words</li>
 </u>
 <li>Go to <a
     href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb" target=_blank>http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb</a>,
     register and log in.</li>
 <li>Select the "submit manuscript" link across the top and upload your manuscript into the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can then confirm that your manuscript has been received by selecting (at the top of the page) "manuscript listing" followed by "author."  Your manuscript's ID tag should appear along the left-hand side.  Following its link will give the current status of the manuscript.</p>

<p>
    We recommend authors look at Joelle Pineau's useful

<h3>
<a class="anchor" name="Reviewing">Reviewing</a></h3>
<p>JMLR has a commitment to a rigorous review process, outlined below.
Due to an ever increasing number of submissions, our timeline is as follows.
After initially submitting a paper, an action editor will be assigned within
about one month. The AE will then pick 3 reviewers who may take 1-3 months to
review your paper. The AE makes the final decision, which will usually be
available within 4-6 months after initial submission.  However, some papers may
take longer (e.g., if they are especially long or complex, or are received
during the review period of a major conference, or if all suitable action
editors are overloaded), and a few papers may take less time (e.g., if they are
rejected without review). The detailed steps are outlined below.</p>


<h4>The JMLR Paper Review Process</h4>
<ol>
<li> When a paper is submitted to JMLR, it is scanned by the Editor-in-Chief (EIC). If the EIC finds that the paper is very clearly below the standards of the journal, or not in its scope, of if there are no suitable action editors, then the paper can be rejected without written review.

<li>  The EIC assigns the paper to an action editor (AE) who has expertise
in the area of the paper.  If the AE finds that the paper is very
likely to be rejected on full review, the AE will write a single short
review explaining that position, and the paper will be rejected.

<li> The AE assigns the paper to three reviewers.  The reviewers write
detailed technical reviews of the paper.

<li> If only one review arrives in reasonable time, and that review is
detailed and of high quality, and recommends rejection, and the AE
agrees with the review, then the AE may decide to reject the paper
based on the single review.  If two reviews come in, and the decision
is clear to the AE, the paper may be accepted or rejected.  Or, the AE
may decide to wait for the third review or even comission additional
reviews, until the decision is clear.

<li>
<!--Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require minor revisions, but they need not be reviewed further. -->
Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require minor revisions, but those are usually checked only by the action editor. Rejection may or may not be accompanied by the encouragement to resubmit.
Papers that are rejected will fall into two categories: those that are permitted to be resubmitted and those that are not.  Authors should obtain explicit permission from an action editor before resubmitting a paper; to avoid misunderstandings, please contact the action editor or editor-in-chief if there is any ambiguity in the decision-making progress.  Permission for resubmission should not be interpreted as any sort of guarantee of acceptance upon resubmission.
</ol>

<a class="anchor" NAME="Publication">Publication</a></h3>
<!--When a paper is accepted, authors retain ownership of the copyright, but must
sign a copyright agreement form giving MIT Press the right to publish the paper.-->
When a paper is accepted, authors must sign an agreement granting a CC-by license to
the public, which allows for publication in JMLR online by JMLR, Inc. and in a
print-archive edition by Microtome Publishing. The copyright remains with the author.
Authors are encouraged to provide electronic forms of any applicable data sets
or executable code.  They are also encouraged to add links
to the article and the JMLR site to their personal web pages; if the authors
wish to create a page pointing to subsequent related research, JMLR will
maintain a link from the original paper to this page. See the <a href="format/authors-guide.html">authors
guide</a> for a detailed checklist of post-acceptance actions.
<p>A quarterly paper volume will be published and sold to libraries and individuals.</p>
