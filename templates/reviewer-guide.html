<h1>TMLR guidelines for reviewers</h1>

<p>
    This document provides instructions for reviewers. Before reading this section, make sure to also read and be familiar with the <a href="editorial-policies.html">Editorial Policies</a>, the <a href="ethics.html">Ethics Guidelines</a>, and the <a href="code.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<h2>Reviewing Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
    As a reviewer, you are expected to hold the following responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Double blind.</b>
    The TMLR review process is meant to be double blind. The identities of the authors of a submission will be kept from the reviewers, and vice versa. You are expected not to take any actions that would violate this double blind state. This includes not actively seeking to find out the identity of the authors of a submission you are reviewing (e.g. by searching for related presentations online or preprints on arXiv). Generally, we suggest you do searches on related work after doing a preliminary read of the submission. If you accidentally discover the identity of the authors, and believe it may influence your judgment, then contact the Action Editor (AE) so they may determine whether you should be unassigned from the submission.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Reviewing.</b>
    As soon as all reviews are submitted for a submission, they will become publicly visible (but anonymous). The authors' response to your review and subsequent discussion will also be immediately visible. You are expected to actively engage with the authors until the issues you have raised for discussion have been sufficiently explored. During this process, you are expected to be respectful and abide by our Code of Conduct. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Annual Quota.</b>
    Reviews are assigned on a rolling basis, as submissions are received. By default, TMLR will not assign you more than six reviews per year. The default quota is 6 papers per year, but it is possible to change it <a href="https://jmlr.org/tmlr/faq.html#reviewer-quota">through the openreview console</a>, as well as to mark yourself temporarily unavailable for periods such as illness, vacation or work leave.
    On the other hand, you are expected to perform all review assignments of submissions that fall within your expertise and quota. Acceptable exceptions include having an unsubmitted review for another TMLR submission. A couple days after being assigned to review a submission, you will be asked by OpenReview to acknowledge the review assignment, so that the Action Editor has a confirmation that you are aware of the assignment and will be submitting it in time.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Review deadline.</b>
    TMLR is committed to a reviewing process with fast turnaround. Therefore, reviews must be submitted within 2 weeks of their assignment by the AE for submissions up to 12 pages (of main content, before references), and 4 weeks for submissions over 12 pages. Two weeks after all reviewers have submitted their review and the discussion with the authors has started (and no later than 1 month), each reviewer will then be allowed to submit a final decision recommendation to the AE.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Conflict of interest.</b> You are responsible for making sure your affiliation and education/career history information is up to date in your OpenReview profile, so we can properly enforce our conflict of interest policy. We consider in conflict any individual or institution with which you have shared a collaboration within the past three years. After being assigned a submission, if you suspect or believe that you have a conflict of interest with any of the authors, consult with the AE for next steps.
</p>

<p>
    <b>LLM use.</b> Reviewers are expected to have read the paper themselves, formed their own opinion, and take responsibility for the writing of their reviews. Reviewers can use LLMs and other tools to assist in these tasks. For instance, it is ok to use LLMs to help find the definition of some notation that the reviewer lost track of, for refining grammar or polishing the language, or checking whether a review is aligned with TMLR's criteria. But the reviewer should form their own internal understanding of the paper, and write a review that reflects and expresses their own opinion.

      <span class="bold">Certification recommendations</span>
      <span class="bold">  </span>
      <span>Certifications</span>
      <span> are meant to highlight particularly notable accepted submissions, and act as public endorsements of the paper in a number of categories. Notably, it is through certifications that we make room for more speculative/editorial judgement on the significance and potential for impact of accepted submissions. Certification selection is the responsibility of the AE, however you are asked to submit your recommendation.</span>
    </p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_pfdlg1ai0z44-0 start">
        <li><span class="bold">Outstanding Certification</span><span class="bold">.
            </span><span>The editorial board of TMLR jointly awards this certification to papers which are deemed to be
                exceptionally high quality and broadly significant for the field. The certification </span><span>may be
                given well after the paper&rsquo;s initial publication in TMLR</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(a year or
                more), and is equivalent to a best paper award at a top-tier conference.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="c1">The remaining four certifications are recommended by reviewers, nominated by action editors and must be
            approved by at least one editor-in-chief:</span></p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_pfdlg1ai0z44-0">
        <li><span class="bold">Featured Certification. </span><span class="c1">This
                certification may be awarded to papers that are very high quality. These papers present significant
                contributions which are novel, clearly explained, and well supported with evidence, theory, or analysis.
                If this paper was submitted to a top-tier conference, it would likely be presented as an
                oral/spotlight.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Expert Reviewer Certification</span><span class="bold">.
            </span><span>This is awarded to papers that are </span><span>authored</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by
                highly-rated TMLR reviewers, to recognize their contributions and expertise.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Reproducibility Certification. </span><span>This is awarded to
                papers whose pri</span><span class="c1">mary purpose is reproduction of other published work. Beyond
                simple verification, the paper must contribute significant added value through additional baselines,
                analysis, ablations, or insights.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Survey</span><span class="bold">&nbsp;Certification.
            </span><span>Papers that not only meet the criteria for acceptance but also provide an exceptionally
                thorough or insightful survey of the topic or approach may be awarded this certification.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="c1">Reviewers are also asked whether they recommend the work to the 
        <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/JournalToConference">NeurIPS</a>/<a href="https://iclr.cc/public/JournalToConference">ICLR</a>/<a href="https://icml.cc/public/JournalToConference">ICML</a> 
        Journal-to-Conference Track. The reviewers' recommendation, along with that of the Action Editor, will determine whether the TMLR submission will receive a <span class="bold">J2C Certification.</span>
        Receiving this selective certification (or the Outstanding/Featured Certifications) enables an opportunity to present in this track at one 
        of the participating conferences. See the <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/JournalToConference">track’s website</a> for details and the complete list of eligibility criteria.</span></p>
